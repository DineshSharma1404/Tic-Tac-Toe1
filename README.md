Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python
This project implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. Players take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their marks (either “X” or “O”) in a row, column, or diagonal.

Features
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game interface is built using the Tkinter library from the Python standard library.
Game Logic: The program handles player moves, checks for wins, and prevents invalid moves.
Play Again Option: After a game ends, players can choose to play again or exit.
How to Play
Run the tic_tac_toe.py script.
The game board will appear with a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their marks.
The game display at the top shows whose turn it is.
If a player wins, the winning combination is highlighted, and a victory message is displayed.
If the game ends in a tie, a message indicates a draw.
